## Set up your development environment.

You’re going to need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), so make sure that is
installed and running on your local environment before proceeding.

Now that you’ve finished setting up your environment files, you can run the
`./up.sh` script from the command line. This will build your Docker images and
start your containers, dropping you off at an open prompt inside your active
development container. From here, run:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

These steps will create and run the migrations that your Django project needs,
walk you through creating an administrator account, and start your development
server. You should now be able to access the following pages:

| Page                        | URL                                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Home _(except in API-only)_ | http://localhost:8002/             |
| Admin                       | http://localhost:8002/admin/       |
| API Documentation           | http://localhost:8002/api/v1/docs/ |

### Running tests

As the name might suggest, you run a lot of tests when you’re doing test-driven
development, so we made it easy with the `./test.sh` script. This is in the
`src` directory inside your container, so you run it from inside the running
container (just like the commands above). This will execute all of your tests,
along with some niceties like setting the `TESTING` environment variable, so
that Django uses an in-memory SQLite database instead of your PostgresSQL
database, which should help your tests run a lot faster.

### Shutting down

When you’re done, you can exit your container by typing `exit` at the prompt.
This will break out of your container and return you to your local environment,
from which you can run `./down.sh` to stop your containers.
