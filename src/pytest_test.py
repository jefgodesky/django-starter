# A test that proves that tests are working. The test stage fails unless it
# finds at least one test, and in the world of abstractions that exist before
# you even begin to develop your site, this will suffice. Once you've written
# your first real test (which should be the first thing you do, since you're
# doing test-driven development, right?), this file no longer has any purpose
# and you can safely delete it.
